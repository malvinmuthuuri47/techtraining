What is Github?

- Github is a code hosting platform for version control and colaboration letting you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 

- The difference between Git and Github is that Git provides the functionality for tracking changes in code while Github is a web-based platform that utilizes Git for version control but adds features to facilitate collaboration, code sharing and project management.

- Developers use Git locally on their computers and Github serves as a remote repository hosting service with additional collaboration tools
